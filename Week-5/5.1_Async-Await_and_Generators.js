/**
 * Exercise 5.1
 * Using Async/Await and Generators, create separate functions and achieve the same functionality.
 * Execute 3 callback functions asynchronously, for example doTask1(), doTask2() and doTask3().
 * 
 * Guidelines:
 * 1. 2 functions should be created. One for Async/Await and the other one for Generators.
 * 2. 3rd party libraries should not be used.
 * 3. Custom Function should carry a meaningful name.
 * 4. The program should execute without errors.
 * 5. The program should achieve the desired result.
 * 6. The program should take care of all 3 states of a Promise.
 * 7. Should be committed to Git with meaningful commit messages.
 * 
 * Outcome:
 * 1. Under the hood understanding of how a Generator works.
 * 2. Under the hood understanding of how Async/await works.
